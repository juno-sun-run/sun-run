# Sun Run
by Emma Clarke, Kristopher McGonegal, Samantha St-Germain and Chris Vaz

## Purpose 
Our group will create an app that will let the user plan their run based on the available sunlight.

## Objective 
The objective of this project is to demonstrate knowledge of all the concepts learned in the Juno bootcamp. Our group will need to integrate HTML, CSS, Javascript and APIs into the React framework, leveraging the use of props, states, components, routing, and information flow.

We will also need to show the ability to work as a group to create one functional app. This will require communication, organization, and conflict resolution.

## Product description
The app will collect the location of the user, convert that to longitude and latitude using a reverse geocoding API, and use that information to retrieve the sunrise/sunset data from the Sunset and Sunrise API. 

The app will also collect information about how long or how far the user wishes to run and whether they wish to run in the evening or the morning. The app will then deliver the time the user should start their run based on the sunlight available.
